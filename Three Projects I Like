I really liked Zimoun’s Kinetic Sculptures for the ambient sound they create and for the appealing look on a large scale. 
In order to create a similar project you would probably need to know some simple laws of physics, understand DC motors 
and how to make a very large number of them work. And have imagination.

MIT Media Lab’s project Materiable looks amazing, and I bet it’s even better if you see it live and can touch it. 
I can’t understand how they make it mimic the properties and shapes of physical materials, 
but it would be interesting to learn. 
Besides for a project like this you would probably need to learn how to construct it.

Barbican’s Rain Room is an interesting project too. 
I think it was in MOMA few years ago, but when I found out about it - it was too late and it closed. 
So I still wonder how weird does it feel to go straight into pouring rain but not to get a single drop on you. 
For this project you would need to understand how this 3D camera tracking system works.
