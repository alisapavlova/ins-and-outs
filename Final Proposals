1) Morse Code Robot Arm
  For this project I would like to create a robot arm that would "translate" typed in sentence into a Morse code
  by simply knocking it on the table. For this project I would need to learn Morse code rules and apply them to the code.
  
2) Interactive Music Webcam Display
  In this project the user would have to use live web camera feed, and will see colored boxes that he/her can interact with 
  by waving hands in the box area. The boxes would produce different sounds throgh speakers. For this project I would need to think 
  more about different boxes' functionalities to be applied for creating music.
  
3) Automated Plant Watering System.
  When I leave for vacations I need someone to water my plants. To be honest, I always forget to do it even when I'm home. 
  For this project I would make an automated watering system that can water my plants when needed. For this project I would need to
  get water pumps that can be controlled by arduino, and make a system of water pipes. It would activate them once in 3 days
  for a period of time depended on plant pot size.
  This project would require some money expenses.
